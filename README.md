# ProjectCleaner
The Project Cleaner tool provides a configurable mechanism to cleanup a project solution and zip it on demand for sharing it across. While the tool is directed at Visual Studio Projects, it can be easily altered and configured to work with any project type - even non Microsoft technologies.
